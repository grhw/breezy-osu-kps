# Breezy KPS (BKPS)
Because all the other ones seem to not support Linux properly.

I give up trying to make binaries for this. If you check the commits I've been trying my absolute best on this, I cannot figure out how to do it. I tried using golang but I can't. This will stay as python for now. (If anyone is willing to help, PLEASE, `@guhw` on discord.)

# How to run
- Install python 3.12.1 (or any version you think will work)
- Download the source code zip from [releases](https://github.com/grhw/breezy-osu-kps/releases/latest/)
- Unzip it anywhere
- Open terminal 
- `cd breezy-osu-kps` (or wherever the folder is)
- `python3 -m pip -r requirements.txt`
- Copy `default_config.json` to `src/`
- `python3 src/main.py`
