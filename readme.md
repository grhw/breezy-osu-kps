# BKPS
Because all the other ones seem to not support Linux properly.

I will release binaries if people for some reason want it.

# How to use
- Get latest binary from releases for your OS
- Run executable
- [Open the key overlay for testing](https://127.0.0.1:6727/)
- Add your keys in `config.json`
- Add to OBS via Browser Source. Height should be 200px, width depends on how many keys you have. (4k is 450)
- If have visualizer turned on in config, the height can be anything above 200px.
