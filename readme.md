# Breezy KPS (BKPS)
Because all the other ones seem to not support Linux properly.

I will release binaries if people for some reason want it.

# How to use
- Get the [latest release](https://github.com/grhw/breezy-osu-kps/releases/latest), download the version for your OS
- [Open the key overlay dashboard](https://127.0.0.1:6727/)
- Add to OBS via Browser Source.
    - Click `Go to Browser Overlay` in the dashboard
    - Copy the URL, and paste it in OBS.
    - Width depends on how many keys you have. (4k is 450)
    - If have visualizer turned on in config, the height can be anything above 200px. Otherwise, set it to 200px only.
